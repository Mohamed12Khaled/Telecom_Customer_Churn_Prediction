# Telecom_Customer_Churn_Prediction

In the increasingly competitive telecommunications sector, customer retention has become a critical priority. Customer churn, defined as customers discontinuing their service and switching to alternative providers, poses a significant challenge as it directly affects revenue and long-term business sustainability. This project aims to develop a predictive model capable of identifying customers who are at high risk of churning by analyzing their service usage patterns, behavioral characteristics, and subscription details. By uncovering these patterns, telecom companies can take proactive measures to enhance customer satisfaction and minimize churn rates.

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for customer churn analysis, encompassing the dataset, data preprocessing steps, and machine learning models used for prediction. In addition to predictive modeling, the project delivers data-driven insights into the key factors influencing customer attrition and proposes strategic recommendations to support telecom companies in strengthening customer retention efforts. For a concise overview of the project.

## Problem Statement

today have multiple service providers to choose from, and even minor issues such as service interruptions, poor technical support, or pricing dissatisfaction can lead them to switch providers.

Customer acquisition is significantly more expensive than customer retention, making churn a direct threat to revenue and long-term business sustainability. Understanding why customers leave, identifying high-risk churn segments, and acting proactively are critical for telecom companies to maintain profitability and customer trust.

Therefore, analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns to predict churn is a vital step toward designing effective retention strategies and improving service quality.
